<h1>Welcome to team5's nginx!</h1>
<p>This is a wiki about the Toyota Supra Second Generation (Harry's Favorite)</p>

<h2> The L-Type and the P-Type</h2>

<p>The L-Type, which stands for Luxury type, was designed for comfort, while the P-type,
short for Performance type, was all about sportiness. While they were both faily identical,
there were many more internal modifications that could be purchased, such as a trip computer
and a digital speedometer, amongst other things <p>

<h2> the 85' Series</h2>

<p> Arguably the best Supra Iteration was the 1985 Toyota Supra 2.8, which offers an 
immensely sleek design with much better acceleration than was previously attainable with previous
models. The 85' series was the last iteration for the A60 series, but remains a favorite among
car enthusiasts due to it's unique design, high cusomization, and impressive performance.
